"""
    Why I don't use lambda:
    Stack Overflow:
        No, it is not supported on Windows. The reason is that multiprocessing lib 
        doesnâ€™t have it implemented on Windows. There are some alternatives 
        like dill that can pickle more objects.

    There are some reasons that I agree with:
        So I don't use lambda, but you can use lambda inside the __getitem__. 
        I think if do that, it will create new objects 
        when __getitem__ called, and it will waste resources.
